# ithomeUserWall
A Python crawling program to generate a picture wall

## Step 1 ##
Run [job.sh](https://github.com/nerocui/ithomeUserWall/blob/master/job.sh), which is linked to [ithome.py](https://github.com/nerocui/ithomeUserWall/blob/master/ithome.py), with `./job.sh`
This will download all the pics into the 'img' folder

## Step 2 ##
Run [photo.sh](https://github.com/nerocui/ithomeUserWall/blob/master/photo.sh), which is linked to [face.py](https://github.com/nerocui/ithomeUserWall/blob/master/face.py), with ./photo.sh
This will get all the pics with at least 1 face to be moved to the 'faces' folder

## Step 3 ##
Run [coll.sh](https://github.com/nerocui/ithomeUserWall/blob/master/coll.sh), which is linked to [li.py](https://github.com/nerocui/ithomeUserWall/blob/master/li.py), with ./coll.sh
This will generate the final photo wall with the name soobin64.png
